# Web Tech Three
The Repository for all things web tech three in 2020

Hi all!

Welcome to the Web Tech Three Repo, here I will be sharing code, replying to questions, providing useful tips/tricks.

## Why a Github Repo?
Well as a developer this is what is familiar with me, it is also somewhere you will likely need to learn how to use, read and manage. 

## What will you find here?
All of the code from tutorials that I run will end up here, it will be clearly labelled and easy to navigate. If there is anything missing please open an "issue" in this repo, I will answer any questions there as well. 

## How to use this repo?
This is designed to be a resource for you to gather code examples, look at references, and ask questions. There is no wrong way to use this repo other than not to use it.
